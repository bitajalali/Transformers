This project demonstrates the use of a ResNet-18 model to classify human actions from the Stanford 40 Actions dataset. It includes data preparation, applying appropriate transformations for training and testing, and fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet-18 model on the dataset. The model is optimized using Adam, and the final accuracy on the test set is calculated. We also provide visualization of the images and their predicted labels to further analyze the modelâ€™s performance.

This code showcases how transfer learning can be applied to action recognition, leveraging the pre-trained ResNet-18 architecture, which has been modified to fit the 40 classes of the Stanford dataset.
